# Mazifer

A <5kb Flutter app that turns any word into a maze!

## Instructions

- Mazifer was tested on Android devices only, but it should be supported by iOS, too.
- The app can be used in any orientation, although I recommend using it in landscape view.
- Do you want to share your maze with your friends or colleagues? For the best resolution, share by email instead of by social media.

## Description

- With only a couple of taps, turn any word into a challenging maze.
- Super-simple step-by-step customization options.
- Share your mazified word over any platform!
  
## About

This was a unique opportunity for me to combine two of my hobbies - Flutter programing and maze drawing. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I did creating it.
